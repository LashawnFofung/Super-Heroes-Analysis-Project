  -  `Gender`: The gender of the hero.
  
  -  `Eye color`: The eye color of the hero.
  
  -  `Race`: The race or species of the hero.
  
  -  `Hair color`: The hair color of the hero.
  
  -  `Height`: The height of the hero (note: '-99.0' typically indicates missing or unknown values).
  
  -  `Publisher`: The comic book publisher associated with the hero (e.g., Marvel Comics, DC Comics).
  
  -  `Skin color`: The skin color of the hero.
  
  -  `Alignment`: The moral alignment of the hero (e.g., 'Good', 'Bad', 'Neutral').
  
  -  `Weight`: The weight of the hero (note: '-99.0' typically indicates missing or unknown values).

This dataset is ideal for performing various analytical tasks related to character demographics, publisher distribution, and other attributes within the superhero universe.
